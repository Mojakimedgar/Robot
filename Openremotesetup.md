OpenRemote
___________________
OpenRemote is the only 100% open source IoT platform that simplifies connecting networked assets to mobile and web applications.

Yes, to use OpenRemote effectively, you typically need a server. OpenRemote provides services and tools for managing IoT devices and platforms, and these are usually run on Docker containers

>>Install Docker Desktop
>> Install WSL
wsl --install 
Ubuntu is the default distribution that will be installed
#WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux, is an incredible feature that allows you to run a full-fledged Linux environment directly on your Windows machine without the overhead of a traditional dual-boot setup or a virtual machine. Essentially, it enables developers to use Linux utilities and tools seamlessly alongside their existing Windows workflow.

1. Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed (v18+).
2. Download the Docker Compose file: OpenRemote Stack (Right click 'Save link as...')

3. In a terminal cd to where you just saved the compose file and then run:

>>cd C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\Docker

>>docker-compose pull
docker-compose pull command will download all the necessary Docker images specified in your docker-compose.yml file. It's a handy command to ensure that all your services have the latest images from your Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

>>docker compose -p openremote up
>>docker compose up -d

to start your Docker Compose project named "openremote." Using the -p flag allows you to specify a project name, which can be helpful if you are running multiple Docker Compose projects.
